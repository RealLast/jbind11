# jbind11 - Seamless operability of Java and C++

This project is currently under development.

jbind11 is the pendant to pybind11 to create bindings for C++ code for Java, using a similiar API as provided by pybind11. 

Some features include:

- expose C++ classes to Java
- expose functions and member functions from C++ to Java
- automatic conversion of native types, for example std::vector to ArrayList and vice versa
- support synchronous asynchronous callbacks
- support of shared pointers
